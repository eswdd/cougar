/**
 * This class is typically used if a library class takes in a "String" which is the file system path of the resource
 * and you don't want to configure/supply the full path.
 *
 * Basically this brings the "Resource" abstraction to the libraries which occasionally use "String" and treat it
 * as a file system path
 *
 * Will not work for "non URL" based resources
 *
 * ex: Disco HttpClient -> uk.co.exemel.disco.client.HttpClientExecutable
